# 🤝 How to Contribute to Project Ojo

Project Ojo is a curated intelligence platform—not a wiki.  
We welcome contributions, but all submissions must go through a review process.

---

## 📬 Submit Intel or Patterns

If you’ve encountered:
- A regional scouting tactic  
- A pattern of grooming or recruitment  
- A known high-risk location or transit hub  
- Local behavior indicators or safe zones

You can submit it for review.

## 🚨 Step 1: Open a GitHub Issue

We do **not** currently accept unsolicited pull requests.

To contribute, please:

1. [Open a new issue →](https://github.com/Ashton-Gates/projectojo/issues/new)
2. Include:
   - Country and city
   - Pattern or tactic
   - Description (what happened, how it was spotted, etc.)
   - Any references or supporting links
   - Whether you're open to follow-up questions

Once reviewed, we'll determine if and where it fits into the live intel.

## 🔒 Why We Don’t Allow Direct Edits

To maintain the integrity of the platform:
- All data is manually reviewed
- Only vetted contributors can edit directly
- We avoid disinformation, exaggeration, and unverified content

This keeps Project Ojo trustworthy—for survivors, researchers, and the people using it to stay safe.

## 🛠️ Future Contributor Platform (Coming Soon)

We plan to build a more user-friendly submission portal with:
- Secure submissions
- Country-specific dashboards
- Survivor-first frameworks

Until then, we review all contributions via GitHub Issues.
