# About Project Ojo

**Project Ojo is an open-source intelligence initiative that exposes how trafficking scouts operate—so you can move safer, recognize the signs, and protect yourself and others.**

We don't just say "stay safe."  
We teach you how to read the signs before you're targeted.

## 🧭 Our Mission

To equip travelers, locals, and NGOs with tactical, region-specific knowledge that identifies how human trafficking scouts operate—by pattern, location, and behavior.

We empower people with real intelligence, not vague warnings.

## 🌍 What Makes Project Ojo Different

Unlike typical travel safety sites or law enforcement briefings, Project Ojo is:

- 🔓 **Open-source** – Anyone can contribute with guidance and vetting
- 🧠 **Pattern-driven** – Built on behavioral cues, not fearmongering
- 📍 **Regionally specific** – Every country has its own tactics, and we track them
- 🧳 **Traveler-first** – Focused on solo travelers, backpackers, nomads, and expats
- 💡 **Prevention-oriented** – Designed to protect before exploitation begins

## 📖 Backstory

Project Ojo was born out of a gap that kept showing up in every "safety tip" for global travel.

Nearly every guide says:
> “Avoid dangerous areas.”  
> “Be cautious of strangers.”  
> “Don’t walk alone at night.”

But **nobody tells you**:
- What **grooming in a club actually looks like**
- That some bus terminals are **known recruitment zones**
- Or how scouts use fake job offers, bar recruitment, or "friendly" locals to lure victims

Trafficking prevention has been hidden behind NGO silos and law enforcement firewalls for too long. We created Project Ojo to change that—by giving real people the **same intelligence investigators use**.

## 👁️ The Name

_"Ojo"_ means “eye” in Spanish — and that's what this platform is:  
An eye on the streets. An eye on the patterns.  
An eye open for those who need it most.
